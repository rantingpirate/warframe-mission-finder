# Warframe Relic Missions

Uses WFCD drop tables to find the best missions for farming relics, etc.


## Running

To run the program, just run `./main.rb` or `ruby main.rb`.

To update the drop data, run `git submodule update`. It's probably a wise idea to do this before running the program for the first time.


## Requirements

 - Ruby

   *This was written for Ruby 2.5.1, but may work under earlier versions of Ruby 2.x.x.*

 - Git

   *For updating the drop data.*
